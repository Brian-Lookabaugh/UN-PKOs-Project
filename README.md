# Do UN Peacekeeping Operations Lead to Peace?

The United Nation's (UN) pacifying role in the world has been stained in the public eye with images of Rwanda Srebrenica (Bosnia) coming to mind. Despite this, most studies evaluating the potentially pacifying effects of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) have largely demonstrated a positive relationship between UN PKOs and peace. However, most studies in this area are limited to correlative analyses. Under such limitations, the best extant research can offer are statements such as "UN PKOs are associated with a decreased amount of conflict". However, researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike are interested in the *causal* impact of UN PKOs. Do UN PKOs actually *lead* to peace? This project employs a inverse probability weighting (IPW) to evaluate the causal impact of UN PKOs on peace. The analysis is still in progress and results are pending.
