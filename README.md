# Living Up to the Name: The Causal Effect of U.N. Peacekeeping Operations on Civilian Well-Being

The United Nation's (UN) pacifying role in the world has been stained in the public eye with images of Rwanda Srebrenica (Bosnia) coming to mind. Despite this, most studies evaluating the potentially pacifying effects of UN peacekeeping operations (PKOs) have largely demonstrated a positive relationship between UN PKOs and peace. However, most studies in this area are limited to correlative analyses. Under such limitations, the best extant research can offer are statements such as "UN PKOs are associated with a decreased amount of conflict". However, researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike are interested in the *causal* impact of UN PKOs. Do UN PKOs actually *lead* to peace? Importantly, do UN PKOs protect the very individuals (civilians) they are designed to protect? Do UN PKOs promote the betterment of civilian lives? This project employs matching and inverse probability weighting (IPW) designed for panel data as implemented by [Imai et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12685) to evaluate the causal impact of UN PKOs on civilian well-being. The analysis is still in progress and results are pending.
